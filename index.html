		<p>
			In August, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced the removal of the Lipari Landfill in Gloucester County, New Jersey from the National Priorities List (NPL) of Superfund Sites after decades of agency-led cleanup efforts. Formerly a dumping ground for a variety of industrial waste including solvents, paints and formaldehyde, it was ranked by the EPA as the <a href="https://dep.nj.gov/newsrel/24_0044/" target="_blank">nation’s most hazardous toxic waste site</a> when added to the Superfund NPL in September 1983.
		</p>

		<p>
			Despite the removal of the site, there still remains much work to be done in New Jersey. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Analysis of EPA Superfund NPL Site data from 2024 found that New Jersey has the highest number of Superfund sites in the nation with 114 sites. California, Pennsylvania and New York follow with 97, 91 and 84 Superfund sites respectively. There are a total of 1,340 Superfund NPL sites nationally.
		</p>

		<p>
			The NPL is an EPA-published list of hazardous waste sites around the nation that are eligible for federal funding to pay for extensive, long-term cleanup actions under the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/superfund/cleaning-superfund-sites" target="_blank">Superfund  remedial program</a>. Superfund sites can <a href="https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-program-protecting-healthy-communities-advancing-environmental-protection" target="_blank">threaten the health of entire communities</a> and pose heightened risks to certain individuals such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. The health effects of environmental contamination at Superfund sites can include cancers and birth defects.

		<p>
			So why does the nation's <a href="https://data.census.gov/profile/New_Jersey?g=040XX00US34" target="_blank">fifth smallest state</a> have so many Superfund sites?
		</p>

		<p>
			Experts point to the state’s industrial roots as the main reason.    
		</p>

		<p>
			During the period after the Revolutionary War, the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/pagr/learn/historyculture/the-birthplace-of-the-american-industrial-revolution.htm" target="_blank">manufacturing industry thrived in New Jersey</a> with the mass production of cotton and wool textiles, locomotives, firearms and machinery in the state. However, a lack of rules regulating the ways in which businesses disposed of industrial manufacturing  waste created the legacy of environmental contamination that the state still fights today.
		</p>

		<p>
			“Before the 1980s it was basically standard practice to dump waste on the ground, in rivers, or leave it out in the open. As a result of that, we have so many uncontrolled or abandoned contaminant sites,” <a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/environment/2023/12/29/nj-superfund-sites-list-bergen-morris-passaic-essex/71970761007/" target="_blank">explained Taylor McFarland</a>, the conservation program manager of the Sierra Club’s New Jersey chapter, to NorthJersey.com. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The construction of the New Jersey Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway in the mid-20th century also made the state an attractive location for warehouses and factories.
		</p>

		<p>
			“We had raw, incredible productivity, but there were no controls,” <a href="https://nj1015.com/polluted-new-jersey-the-most-toxic-sites-in-your-neighborhood/" target="_blank">said Pete Lopez</a>, the EPA regional administrator, to New Jersey 101.5 WKXW Radio. “If you want to look for a parallel, just look at where China and India are in our current day: You can see massive pollution, massive degradation and raw economic output without environmental controls in place,” he added.
		</p>

		<p>
			Today, New Jersey has some of the country’s strictest environmental laws. In 2020, it was the first state in the nation to pass <a href="https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/bill-search/2024/S232" target="_blank">environmental justice legislation</a> requiring the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection to reject permits for facilities such as gas-fired power plants, sewage plants and recycling facilities if they pose a disproportionately negative environmental or public health impact on overburdened communities. Such communities often include low-income neighborhoods or communities of color.   
		</p>


		<p>
			Earlier this year, the EPA <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-funds-cleanups-three-superfund-sites-new" target="_blank">announced</a> the final $1 billion wave of funding from the $3.5 billion allocated for Superfund cleanup work as part of President Biden’s 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The funding would help support remediation activities at three Superfund sites in New Jersey. This is in addition to the seven other New Jersey Superfund sites selected for remediation with support from earlier rounds of Infrastructure Law investment funding. Nationally, more than 150 NPL Superfund sites are expected to benefit from the funding.
